At dawn, the city felt briefly honest, as if it had forgotten to perform. Shop shutters hovered half-open, painted with old advertisements and newer promises, while stray dogs negotiated territory with the patience of seasoned diplomats. The air carried that indecisive smell caught between night's rain and morning's dust, cool enough to wake you but gentle enough to make you linger. Somewhere a kettle whistled too early in an apartment with thin walls, and a busker practiced chords no one would hear for hours, fingers stiff but hopeful.

People moved through the streets with the soft confidence of routines not yet interrupted-tea sellers lighting burners, newspaper bundles thudding onto doorsteps, joggers counting breaths instead of time. Traffic signals blinked lazily, governing almost nothing, and the sky shifted colors as if testing moods for the day ahead. By noon, meetings would pile up, horns would argue endlessly, and everyone would swear the day had always been loud. Yet for these few minutes, the city existed in a rare pause, quietly proving that calm was never absent-only temporarily ignored.
